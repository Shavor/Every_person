      The criminal justice system can't support safe, whole communities without
      feedback on what’s working and what’s not. We stitch together data from
      fragmented systems to provide decision-makers with the information they
      need to improve outcomes. With this data, we surface opportunities to
      safely chart a path to a smaller system, and to track the impact of policy
      and practice changes over time.
